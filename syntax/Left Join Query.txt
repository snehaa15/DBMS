Left Join Query:

The LEFT JOIN is a type of inner join where it returns all the records from the left table and matching records from the right table. Here, the left table is a table that comes to the left side or before the "LEFT JOIN" phrase in the query, and the right table refers to a table that comes at the right side or after the "LEFT JOIN" phrase. It returns NULL for all non-matching records from the right table.

In some databases, it is called LEFT OUTER JOIN.

syntax:
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

example:
SELECT emp.emp_id, emp.FirstName, dept.Dept_Id, dept.Name 
FROM Employes emp 
LEFT JOIN Department dept
ON emp.Dept_Id = dept.Dept_Id;
