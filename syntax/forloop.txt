PL/SQL FOR Loop

PL/SQL for loop is used when when you want to execute a set of statements for a predetermined number of times. The loop is iterated between the start and end integer values. The counter is always incremented by 1 and once the counter reaches the value of end integer, the loop ends.

Syntax of for loop:

FOR counter IN initial_value .. final_value LOOP  
  LOOP statements;   
END LOOP;  
initial_value : Start integer value
final_value : End integer value

FOR k IN 1..10 LOOP  
-- note that k was not declared  
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(k);  
END LOOP;  
END;
