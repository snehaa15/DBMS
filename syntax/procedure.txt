PL/SQL Procedure:

The PL/SQL stored procedure or simply a procedure is a PL/SQL block which performs one or more specific tasks. It is just like procedures in other programming languages.

The procedure contains a header and a body.

Header: The header contains the name of the procedure and the parameters or variables passed to the procedure.
Body: The body contains a declaration section, execution section and exception section similar to a general PL/SQL block.
How to pass parameters in procedure:
When you want to create a procedure or function, you have to define parameters .There is three ways to pass parameters in procedure:

IN parameters: The IN parameter can be referenced by the procedure or function. The value of the parameter cannot be overwritten by the procedure or the function.
OUT parameters: The OUT parameter cannot be referenced by the procedure or function, but the value of the parameter can be overwritten by the procedure or function.
INOUT parameters: The INOUT parameter can be referenced by the procedure or function and the value of the parameter can be overwritten by the procedure or function.
A procedure may or may not return any value.

PL/SQL Create Procedure
Syntax for creating procedure:

CREATE [OR REPLACE] PROCEDURE procedure_name  
    [ (parameter [,parameter]) ]  
IS  
    [declaration_section]  
BEGIN  
    executable_section  
[EXCEPTION  
    exception_section]  
END [procedure_name];  

 procedure example
In this example, we are going to insert record in user table. So you need to create user table first.

Table creation:

create table user(id number(10) primary key,name varchar2(100));  
Now write the procedure code to insert record in user table.

Procedure Code:

create or replace procedure "INSERTUSER"    
(id IN NUMBER,    
name IN VARCHAR2)    
is    
begin    
insert into user values(id,name);    
end;    
/
