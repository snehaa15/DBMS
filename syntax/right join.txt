SQL Right Join:

The RIGHT JOIN is the reverse of LEFT JOIN. The RIGHT JOIN query returns all the records from the right table and matching records from the left table.

Here, the right side table is a table that comes to the right side or after the "RIGHT JOIN" phrase in the query, and the left table is a table that comes at the left side or before the "RIGHT JOIN" phrase.

The RIGHT JOIN returns NULL for all non-matching records from the left table. In some databases, it is called RIGHT OUTER JOIN.

syntax:
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

example:
SELECT dept.Dept_Id, dept.Name, emp.emp_id, emp.FirstName  
FROM Employes emp 
RIGHT JOIN Department dept
ON emp.Dept_Id = dept.Dept_Id;
