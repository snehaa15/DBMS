Characteristics of DBMS

It uses a digital repository established on a server to store and manage the information.
It can provide a clear and logical view of the process that manipulates data.
DBMS contains automatic backup and recovery procedures.
It contains ACID properties which maintain data in a healthy state in case of failure.
It can reduce the complex relationship between data.
It is used to support manipulation and processing of data.
It is used to provide security of data.
It can view the database from different viewpoints according to the requirements of the user.

Advantages of DBMS

Controls database redundancy: It can control data redundancy because it stores all the data in one single database file and that recorded data is placed in the database.

Data sharing: In DBMS, the authorized users of an organization can share the data among multiple users.

Easily Maintenance: It can be easily maintainable due to the centralized nature of the database system.

Reduce time: It reduces development time and maintenance need.

Backup: It provides backup and recovery subsystems which create automatic backup of data from hardware and software failures and restores the data if required.

multiple user interface: It provides different types of user interfaces like graphical user interfaces, application program interfaces

Disadvantages of DBMS

Cost of Hardware and Software: It requires a high speed of data processor and large memory size to run DBMS software.

Size: It occupies a large space of disks and large memory to run them efficiently.

Complexity: Database system creates additional complexity and requirements.

Higher impact of failure: Failure is highly impacted the database because in most of the organization, all the data stored in a single database and if the database is damaged due to electric failure or database corruption then the data may be lost forever.
